# Optical Ray-Tracer
Year two computing project at Imperial

## Project goals (taken verbatim from the assignment)

1. design and write an optical ray tracer in Python using object-oriented programming
2. test and verify the operation of the ray-tracer
3. use the ray-tracer to investigate the imaging performance of simple lenses
4. use the ray-tracer to optimise the design of a biconvex lens
